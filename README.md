I was bored and decided to set a 30-day challenge for myself to build one mini project each day from simple to most challenging ones and this happened to be my #day-1 miniproject called **The Counter**

## Getting started
If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

Download the ZIP from this location, or run the following git command to clone the files to your machine:
- Once the files are on your machine, open the counter application folder in Visual Studio Code.
- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the Go Live button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with Live Server.
